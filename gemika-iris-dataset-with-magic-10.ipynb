    "Greetings, my daring young spellcasters! I’m Professor Gerry Leo Nugroho, your guide through the wondrous skies of data science at Hogwarts, and a loyal friend of Albus Dumbledore. Last time, we climbed to [Dumbledore’s office and summoned a Random Forest](https://dev.to/gerryleonugroho/gemikas-enchanted-guide-to-iris-dataset-with-magic-and-machine-learning-part-9-oh/edit)—a grove of enchanted trees that predicted our Iris Dataset species with the wisdom of a hundred professors! 🌲 Now, my little Gryffindor phoenix, Gemika Haziq Nugroho, and I are watching Fawkes take flight. It’s time to measure our magic’s might—how well did our spells soar? ✨📊"

We’ll use magical tools—accuracy and `confusion matrices`—to count our triumphs, like tallying points in the House Cup!
