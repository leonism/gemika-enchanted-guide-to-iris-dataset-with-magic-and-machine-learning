    "**Professor KNN**, the ever-watchful guardian of nearest neighbors, adjusted his spectacles and nodded sagely. “Ah, yes. I have consulted the whispers of the flowers past. This one… belongs to *Setosa!*” He tapped his wand against his scroll, and the name shimmered in the air. 🧙‍♂️📜  \n",

    "Beside him, the venerable **Professor Decision Tree**, his long robes embroidered with branching patterns of wisdom, furrowed his brow. “Indeed,” he intoned, tracing invisible paths through the air, “the petals align, the sepals whisper… *Setosa!*” His voice echoed like the rustling of ancient leaves, his judgment firm as oak. 🌳✨  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, from the depths of the **Forbidden Forest**, where shadows danced between towering boughs, came the enigmatic Random Forest. The murmurs of a hundred trees whispered in unison, their voices intertwining into a single, unwavering decree: “*Setosa!*” 🌲🌲🌲  \n",
    "\n",
    "A hush fell over the hall. The prediction had been made, thrice confirmed, as if spoken by the very Sorting Hat itself. The magical bloom belonged not to the bold *`Versicolor`* nor the mysterious *`Virginica`*, but to the noble *`Setosa`*!  \n",
