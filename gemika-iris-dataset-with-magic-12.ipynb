    "I’m **Professor Gerry Leo Nugroho**, your guide through the enchanted realms of data science at Hogwarts, and a dear friend of Albus Dumbledore. Last time, we stepped into the Room of Requirement for a grand finale, predicting new Iris Dataset flowers with our KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest spells—guesses as sharp as a phoenix’s beak! 🌸  \n",

    "And he’s right—we’ve journeyed from meeting the Iris scroll with `pandas` to brewing dazzling charts in Snape’s dungeon, from taming data dragons with Hagrid to casting spells with Flitwick, McGonagall, and Dumbledore’s wisdom. 🌺  \n",

    "- **Pandas** summoned our Iris scroll, like an owl with a letter.  \n",
    "- **Seaborn** and **Plotly** brewed moving charts, brighter than a Weasley prank.  \n",
    "- **Train_test_split** divided our data, like picking Triwizard champions.  \n",
    "- **KNN**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests** predicted flower types—charms, branches, and forests of guesses!  \n",
    "- **Accuracy** and **confusion matrices** graded our magic, as precise as McGonagall’s quill.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s next? Try new datasets—like Hogwarts student scores or Quidditch stats! Cast spells like **Support Vector Machines** or **Neural Networks**—they’re like advanced charms waiting in the Restricted Section. The magic’s endless, young wizards—keep waving your wands! 📊🪄  \n",
