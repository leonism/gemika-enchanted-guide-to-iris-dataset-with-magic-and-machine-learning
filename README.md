# Iris Dataset Project

## Project Overview

The Iris Dataset project is a Python-based project that works with the popular Iris flower dataset. The project aims to provide tools for analyzing the dataset, training machine learning models, and visualizing results. This dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning due to its simplicity and the clear distinctions between its classes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-dataset.git
   cd iris-dataset
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can start by exploring the Jupyter notebooks or running the scripts provided to analyze the dataset. Here is a simple example to load and view the dataset:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
print(iris.data)
print(iris.target)
```

## Relevant Details

- **Dependencies:** All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
- **Dataset:** The Iris dataset is publicly available and can be directly loaded using libraries such as `scikit-learn`.
